1. Did you use a single message identifier for all message types in your system, or different one for each type of message? Why?  
2. Did you have to change how your seen messages worked? Why or why not? 
3. How did the state-oriented CRDT we used for Lab 9 differ from the operation-oriented CRDT we used in this lab? 
4. Is it possible for a node to issue two positive threshold violation messages (i.e. value = 1) without an intervening negative threshold violation messages (i.e. value = -1)? Justify your analysis. What are the consequences of such a scenario?  
5. How does gossip messaging combined with CRDT compare with Paxos? Consider the threshold counter we implemented for this lab. How would it be different if you tried to use Paxos to implement it? 
6. How does gossip messaging combined with CRDT compare with Byzantine consensus (like in a blockchain)?
