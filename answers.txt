1. This lab uses a vector clock (Links to an external site.) algorithm to create unique message IDs based on a sequence number. Could we replace the sequence number with a timestamp? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach?
I believe we can! Since we can still compare the sequence using timestamp, it is a valid way to do it.
The pros is that we can look at the time now, and the cons is that it is a bit more complicated to compare.

2. Are the temperature messages in order? Why or why not? If not, what could you do to fix this?
The temperature messages are in order based on what I observed.

3. How did you avoid looping (sending messages back to someone who already has it)? Why was the unique ID helpful?
We use the unique ID to check if it is there already. It is useful because we can check which pico has received the messages.

4. The propagation algorithm sleeps for n seconds between each iteration. What are the trade-offs between a low and high value for n.
A low value has the benefit that it comes to consistency faster but use up more computing resources.
Whereras a high value has the benefit that it takes longer for the consistency, but need less computing resources. 

5. Did new messages eventually end on all the nodes that were connected? Were the messages displayed in the same order on each node? Why or why not?
Yes, no it is not because it takes different time to reach the message to those picos.

6. Why does temporarily disconnecting a node from the network not result in permanent gaps in the messages seen at that node?
Because there will be missing state(private state) for the pico, it is hard to track.

7. Describe, in a paragraph or two, how you could use the basic scheme implemented here to add failure detection to the system using a reachability table.
